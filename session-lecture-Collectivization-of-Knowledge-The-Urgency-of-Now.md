# Collectivization of Knowledge: The Urgency of Now

Overview: Take a moment to consider: Would you have the job you do if an algorithm was the sole factor in hiring you? Christina Colclough will provide an overview of issues and Johnnie Penn will lead this discussion session. This session looks at information asymmetries, specifically in the context of data, dangerous paths for algorithms, the need for human in command, and imagines: what if our data could work for us?

# Student Engagement

We will elicit feedback from students in three phases: First, we will ask your feedback on alternative potential paradigms for the use and protection of personal data. Then we will provide all students an opportunity to review and prioritize the responses from the class.  Second, we will provide the top few proposed alternative paradigms and ask what benefits, costs and unintended consequences or other risks could arise from each top proposed alternative paradigm.  We will curate the responses and provide them back to the class as a whole.  Third, we will ask how you would propose implementing one each top proposed paradigm inclduding what business, social, economic, policy or other practical steps would be needed.  Will wilk also ask what legal framerwork would be needed to implement and sustain the top proposed paradigms.   We will curate the responses and provide them back to the class as a whole and provide the entire exercise to Christina and Jonnie for their feedback by YouTube and we will share that feedback with the class as a whole.
