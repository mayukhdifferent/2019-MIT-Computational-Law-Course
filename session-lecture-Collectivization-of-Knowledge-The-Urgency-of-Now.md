# Collectivization of Knowledge: The Urgency of Now

Overview: Take a moment to consider: Would you have the job you do if an algorithm was the sole factor in hiring you? Christina Colclough will provide an overview of issues and Johnnie Penn will lead this discussion session. This session looks at information asymmetries, specifically in the context of data, dangerous paths for algorithms, the need for human in command, and imagines: what if our data could work for us?

## Student Engagement

We will elicit feedback from students in three phases: 

* First, we will ask your feedback on alternative potential paradigms for the use and protection of personal data. Then we will provide all students an opportunity to review and prioritize the responses from the class.  We will collect your feedback on this initial question through Friday, February 1st.  The results of this first phase of student proposed potential alternatives is available for review below.

* Second, we will provide the top few proposed alternative paradigms and ask what benefits, costs and unintended consequences or other risks could arise from each top proposed alternative paradigm.  We will curate the responses and provide them back to the class as a whole.  

* Third, we will ask how you would propose implementing one each top proposed paradigm including what business, social, economic, policy or other practical steps would be needed.  Will wilk also ask what legal framerwork would be needed to implement and sustain the top proposed paradigms.   We will curate the responses and provide them back to the class as a whole and provide the entire exercise to Christina and Jonnie for their feedback by YouTube and we will share that feedback with the class as a whole. 

> NOTE: We have extended the deadline for this session and will accept responses to phase 2 and 3 questions through Friday 15th, 2019.

## What alternative paradigm can you propose for use and protection of personal data?

Student proposed alternatives follow:

### Alternative 1: US Constitution 1st Amendment Paradigm

The framework may be the US Constitution 1st Amendment, right to free speech (or not to speak). Existing identity-dossiers about beliefs/values assembled by AI are unconsented appropriations of speech. 

Willing release of identity data requires knowledge of benefits (customer profiling for mutually beneficial mass customization) – or a citizen's implied consent for safety (TSA inspection), knowledge of potential uses and laws defining lines users cannot cross (HIPAA).

To prevent unconsented release, data should be embargoed (Sovrin container) with release normally requiring express consent, perhaps with rescission period (HUD mortgage) and use limited to time periods (Snapchat at one extreme).

Data now in the wild is too problematic to pull back but amnesty for the FAANGs is not OK (nor was the Music Modernization Act's gift to the DSPs). Individuals should have the right to see/dispute/correct all their identify-dossiers (FCRA; a major line extension opportunity for Experian/TransUnion/EquiFax).

### Alternative 2: Open Source Software Paradigm

I propose a paradigm based on open source software. The current paradigm in which big companies accumulate massive amounts of data can be stopped only by a movement of experts developing an open source software that would enable individuals to protect their data. This software would act as an intermediary between an individual and a company which products one wants to use. All data would be only collected within one place – in an open source software – and only after one would agree to transfer it to the given company it would be able to publish it or use it in any other way. From technological point of view it seems challenging and worth discussing during the live session. I would propose something similar to ProtonMail zero access architecture. In this way no company would be able to have access to data – only individuals. This mechanism would allow to precipitate couple of changes. Firstly, it would most likely create a market for data – people would start earning money if they decided to share data. In the data-driven economy it seems like a natural change. Secondly, it would make people aware of the amounts of data they share with private companies. Thirdly, it would be possible to ban and enforce sharing some kinds of data through this software – it is connected to the discussions we had during the Legal Frameworks for Humanity session.


### Alternative 3: Supra National Harmonized Rules on Data Protection

In my opinion a possible alternative solution can be represented by the implementation of harmonized rules about data protection which act at a “supra” national level (a sort of soft law at an international level). Let’s call them UNIData principles (my random name suggestion for this paradigm). Let’s assume that these UNIData rules are not mandatory, everything is based on trust. For instance: there is a company which is compliant with UNIData principles (and maybe it has a certificate, similar to ISO 9001) so consumers/workers know that they can trust this company about the protection of their data.

Concerning the content of UNIData, there shall be principles that guarantee a high level protection of personal data: the acceptance of terms and conditions is not sufficient, increase of opt-out rights, simplifications of the procedures in order to easily exercise the right to be forgotten.

Unintended consequences: increase of compliance costs, possible effects on competition for small enterprises. Possible reactions of domestic supervisory authorities to be evaluated.

Benefits: increase of international transaction, improvement of consumers and workers’ protection.

How do we actually implement this? Creation of a UNIData Committee composed of experts in different fields (legal experts/data scientists/engineers etc.) for the elaboration of UNIData principles and maybe creation of a supervisory institution which gives advice on the implementation and interpretation of the principles.

How do we engineer the legal responsibilities and relationship about this? This paradigm is conceived as a soft law, so any company is free to adhere. At the same time, it is necessary to attract interest on this project and on its benefits in order to guarantee effectivity and the spread of the principles.

### Alternative 4: DecentralizedVariablePrivacy {DVP}

DecentralizedVariablePrivacy {DVP}

Our Understanding of Organizations and Data is inadequate for what is about to happen.

Starting next year we are going to start to see the first trials of Fling Taxi Drones (Uber Air).

Four to five years latter there will be operational deployment. Autonomous Cars are already here. 
In the next 3 to 4 years they will start replace humans. Robots now have the dexterity of humans.
Blockchains and software agents AI will replace most white collar jobs as we know them in 5 Years.

It is easy to believe that all or problems are because the big 5 own all or data. 

There is great danger thinking the problems are the current corporations. There are much bigger
problems then how the big 5 own data. 

China is beating us in intelligence (AI). Then nature of work is about to change rapidly.


People are scared. People are worried.
They are afraid of their data is centralized and that it will be used against them.

Rest assured this will not be the case.
We are going to have to be prepared.
80% of all jobs will be eliminated in the next 10 years. If you work with your hands your job will be replaced by a robot. If you work in an office your job will be replaced by a Blockchain. The reality is your job will not be replaced but rather your entire industry will be eliminated.

There is Hope.
There will be plenty of opportunity for all to earn it decent living- one even better than what they have now.

We are obsessed now with data privacy, and the centralized control of corporations. Blockchains, robotics and AI, however, will eliminate whole industries and the centralize control of data.

As we move into the world of blockchains
Centralize control of data will be pushed out to the edges of the network.

These efficiencies (of blockchains) will allow push DATA to the edges of the network (closer to the people).

Centralized control of data will be come less of an issue Because elimination of whole industries will also elimination those centralized corporate controls.

Opportunity, data privacy and
control will pass closer to the hands of the people and edge organizations.

We should not focus on centralized corporations and their data privacy but rather the mechanisms that allow more people to have control of data at the edges of the network.

What you want is individuals AND entities at the edges of the network to be able to specify a variable range of privacy and control over their data.

The most efficient path forward is NOT to try to legislate Data silo’ed corporations
but rather promote the Evolution of data used at the edges of the network where People and edge organizations can have direct control over their data and it’s monetization.

You cannot have computational laws about DATA (privacy) unless you have a computable form of contract.   
To do this you need a computable form of  jurisdiction.   
If you want people (and edge entities) to receive financial benefits from their data .  
They must be able to efficiently pay taxes.   
To do this you need a computable form tax payment.

To speed innovation in Law, toward these ends, you want a WireProtocol (defined below) for specifying jurisdiction,  tax payment and proof of age (eg over 18 in most jurisdictions).

What is needed is A Wire Protocal is Like ERC-20 (Which specifies what the bytes are) such as:

* WireProtocolForTaxes
* WireProtocolForJuristiction
* WireProtocolForProofOf18

The reason you want a WireProtocol (like ERC-20) is because the the geeks can write (anything to it) in any language.

You cannot do this with an API or Rest.....

Law published as a WireProtocol allows it to be use in ALL languages and ANY Blockchain.

This is the fastest way to spur innovation and put control of data and financial benefit of data into the hands of people (and entities) that are at the edges of the network ( non centralized control).
